# XIVHead
Capstone project for CSC 521

This website is a very very very simple mock of World of Warcraft's popular Wowhead website.
The layout and name of the sites will be similar, but XIVHead will be no way near as powerful.

Current guaranteed features:
- Authentication - Allows you to comment on the resource guide pages located on the nav bar
- Lodestone News API incorporated to show the latest 20 news on the homepage.
- Resource pages located at the top showing what I think is the best guides for the listed content
- Profile Page  
- Light/Dark Mode

Features to add if given enough time:
- Search bar to find news/resource pages
- Edit the Lodestone News API to show more news beyond the first 20
- Implementation of another API to link FF14 character to your XIVHead Account

3/28 Updates:
- Comments collection created for each 4 webpage.
 - Comments need to be allowed to be deleted only if the user made it
  - Might take a lazy way out and only allow admin delete/update.
- Email need API implementation to make sure the email is valid.

4/21 Updates:
- Admin functionality
 - Only admin can delete comments/user accounts
